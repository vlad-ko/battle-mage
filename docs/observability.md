# Observability

Battle Mage observability has two layers:

1. **Structured logs** — every event (mention, tool call, agent completion, answer posted, errors) is emitted as a JSON line to stdout AND as a Sentry event. See "Log Format" and "Event Catalog" below.
2. **Tracing** — not on the roadmap. `vercelAIIntegration` stays wired in `sentry.server.config.ts` for the day we want OpenTelemetry `gen_ai.*` spans, but capturing them would require migrating the agent loop off the bare `@anthropic-ai/sdk` onto Vercel AI SDK's `streamText`, which would touch the parallel-tools dispatch (#77), compaction (#76), budget guards (#93), and streaming pipeline. The refactor cost vs. the marginal visibility over our existing request-correlated logs + per-turn metrics footer + Sentry stack traces isn't favorable. Revisit only if an independent reason to rewrite the agent loop appears.

The rest of this doc focuses on logs — traces will get their own section once spans are flowing.

## Viewing Logs

**Vercel Dashboard:** Project > Logs (real-time tail with filtering)

**CLI:**
```bash
vercel logs --prod          # Last entries
vercel logs --prod --follow # Live tail
```

**Retention:** 1 hour (Hobby), 1 day (Pro), 3 days (Enterprise). For longer retention, set up a [Log Drain](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/log-drains) to Datadog, Axiom, or similar.

**Sentry (primary sink for production):** Vercel's `vercel logs` CLI drops writes made inside Next.js `after()` callbacks — a known serverless quirk. All of battle-mage's per-round agent logs (`agent_start`, `agent_tool_call`, `agent_complete` with cache + token metrics, `answer_posted`) happen inside `after()`, so they surface through Sentry, not the Vercel log drain.

`SENTRY_DSN` in your Vercel project env vars overrides the hardcoded public DSN baked into `sentry.server.config.ts` / `sentry.edge.config.ts` / `src/instrumentation-client.ts`. **Important:** the hardcoded fallback means Sentry is active even when `SENTRY_DSN` is unset — code built from this repo always ships telemetry somewhere. To truly disable Sentry you must remove the hardcoded fallback (or comment out `Sentry.init`); unsetting the env var alone does not stop data egress. With Sentry active, `sentry.server.config.ts` wires `consoleLoggingIntegration` so every `console.log(JSON.stringify(...))` emitted by the logger is captured and shipped to Sentry's Logs UI automatically — no explicit `Sentry.logger.*` calls in application code. See [Sentry Next.js SDK docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/) for setup.

**Sentry Logs is a billed product.** Each org gets a monthly byte quota (5 GB included on Team/Business; zero on the Developer free tier). When the quota is exhausted, Sentry responds `429 log_byte_usage_exceeded` and every log envelope is silently dropped until the window resets or pay-as-you-go is enabled. Exception events use a separate quota (`error`), so Issues may keep arriving while Logs go dark. If you see an empty Logs UI despite traffic, verify the org's logs usage in Settings → Subscription before digging into SDK config.

**Operator note — data that flows to Sentry.** Structured log payloads include Slack question snippets (first 100 chars), tool input parameters, and GitHub repo paths. `sendDefaultPii` is off by default so IP and user-agent are NOT attached. If your compliance posture forbids this data leaving your tenant, you must (a) remove the hardcoded DSN fallback in the three Sentry config files and leave `SENTRY_DSN` unset so `Sentry.init` receives no DSN and becomes a no-op, (b) self-host Sentry via their on-prem offering, or (c) add a redaction layer inside `src/lib/logger.ts` before the `console.log` call. Simply unsetting `SENTRY_DSN` without removing the fallback will NOT stop data egress.

Why this works on Vercel when stdout doesn't: `@sentry/nextjs` internally calls `vercelWaitUntil(Sentry.flush())` to hold the function container open until events are transmitted. That's the same mechanism `getsentry/junior` uses on their Vercel-hosted Hono agent.

### The `after()` tail-drop gotcha (#98)

The SDK's auto-flush above fires at **route-handler response time** — which runs BEFORE Next.js's `after()` callbacks. Any log emitted inside `after()` (where BM does its real work: agent loop, answer post, reaction handlers, KV writes) lands in the Sentry buffer AFTER the auto-flush has already fired, and relies on the 5-second weight-timer for its next drain. Vercel often freezes the container before that timer runs — dropping the tail of the log stream.

**Fix:** every `after()` body ends with `await flushLogs(rlog, "<flow>")` in its `finally` block. `flushLogs` emits `turn_end` and then explicitly calls `Sentry.flush(2000)` to drain the buffer before the container hibernates. This matches the SDK's own `flushSafelyWithTimeout` internal pattern.

If you add a new `after()` callback, **you must end it with `flushLogs`** or its logs will tail-drop. The unit test at `src/lib/logger.test.ts` pins the explicit-flush behavior so accidental regression fails loudly in CI.

## Log Format

Every log entry is a single JSON line:

```json
{"event":"mention_received","requestId":"a3f2b1c4","channel":"C0G9QF9GZ","user":"U024BE7LH","question":"what does the auth module do?","ts":1711924800000}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event` | string | What happened (see event catalog below) |
| `requestId` | string | 8-char ID correlating all events in one webhook invocation |
| `ts` | number | Unix timestamp in milliseconds |
| ...data | various | Event-specific context |

## Request Correlation

Every webhook invocation creates a `requestId` (8-char random string). All log entries from that invocation share the same ID. This lets you trace a single question from mention to answer:

```
Filter: requestId=a3f2b1c4

{"event":"mention_received","requestId":"a3f2b1c4","question":"what does auth do?","ts":1711924800000}
{"event":"agent_start","requestId":"...","promptLength":4200,"ts":1711924800050}
{"event":"agent_tool_call","requestId":"...","tool":"search_code","round":0,"ts":1711924800100}
{"event":"agent_tool_call","requestId":"...","tool":"read_file","round":1,"ts":1711924802000}
{"event":"agent_complete","requestId":"...","rounds":2,"duration_ms":3500,"ts":1711924803500}
{"event":"answer_posted","requestId":"...","channel":"C0G9QF9GZ","ts":1711924804000}
```

## Event Catalog

### Webhook Events (route.ts)

| Event | When | Key data |
|-------|------|----------|
| `signature_rejected` | Slack signature verification fails | — |
| `mention_received` | @bm mentioned in a channel | channel, user, question |
| `thread_followup` | Reply in thread where bot is participating | channel, threadTs |
| `reaction_checkmark` | ✅ on a proposal message | channel, messageTs |
| `reaction_received` | **Any** `reaction_added` dispatched to the bot's handler (fires before validation) | reaction, reactingUser, targetTs, channel |

### Agent Events (claude.ts)

| Event | When | Key data |
|-------|------|----------|
| `agent_start` | Agent loop begins | promptLength, question, model |
| `agent_tool_call` | Each tool execution | tool, round, input (truncated) |
| `agent_complete` | Agent produces final answer | rounds, refCount, hasProposal, duration_ms |
| `prompt_feedback_included` | System prompt assembled — fires **every** turn, even when no entries | positiveCount, negativeCount, totalEntries, promptZone |

### Index Events (repo-index.ts)

| Event | When | Key data |
|-------|------|----------|
| `index_cache_hit` | Index is fresh, using cached version | sha |
| `config_loaded` | .battle-mage.json read from repo | hasConfig, pathCount |
| `index_rebuilt` | Index rebuilt after SHA change | sha, topicCount, fileCount, duration_ms |
| `index_build_error` | Index build failed | message |

### Response Events (route.ts)

| Event | When | Key data |
|-------|------|----------|
| `answer_posted` | Bot's answer sent to Slack | channel, threadTs, chunks |
| `issue_created` | GitHub issue created after ✅ | number |
| `followup_agent_start` | Thread follow-up triggering agent | channel, threadTs |

### KV Events (lib/kv.ts) — #117

Every persistent-state operation flows through `src/lib/kv.ts`, which wraps the `@upstash/redis` client. Per-op events give us latency distribution, hit rate, and distinct visibility into KV-layer failures (Upstash outage vs. a generic route error).

| Event | When | Key data |
|-------|------|----------|
| `kv_client_init` | Module load (once per cold start) | library (`@upstash/redis`) |
| `kv_op` | Every successful op | op (`get`/`set`/`del`/`zadd`/`zrange`/`zrem`), keyPrefix, durationMs, and per-op metadata: `hit` (get), `valueSize`+`ttlSec` (set), `deleted` (del), `removed` (zrem), `rangeSize` (zrange) |
| `kv_error` | Every failed op (also `Sentry.captureException`) | op, keyPrefix, durationMs, errorClass, errorMessage (sliced to 200 chars). Sentry tags: `kv.op`, `kv.keyPrefix`. |

**Why `keyPrefix`, not the full key:** full keys contain channel IDs and message timestamps (`feedback:context:C01ABCDEF:1234.5678`) — not privacy-sensitive per se, but cardinality-hostile for aggregation. The first segment (`feedback`, `knowledge`, `pending-correction`, `repo-index`, `slack-users`) combined with `op` gives clean bucketing (e.g., `{op: get, keyPrefix: feedback}` for context lookups vs. `{op: zrange, keyPrefix: feedback}` for entry-list reads).

### Feedback Events (route.ts) — #114

Every reaction flows through this event funnel. `reaction_skipped` and `feedback_saved` are **mutually exclusive outcomes** of a given `reaction_received`. When diagnosing "my 👍 did nothing", filter for `reaction_skipped` with the user's `reactingUser` first — silent drops used to be invisible and are now fully logged.

| Event | When | Key data |
|-------|------|----------|
| `reaction_skipped` | The handler decided to drop the reaction | reaction, reason (`non_message_item` / `bot_own_reaction` / `target_not_bot_message` / `no_qa_context`), targetTs, channel |
| `feedback_saved` | A 👍 or 👎 passed validation and was recorded | type, answerTs, chunkIndex, chunkCount, latencyMs, referenceCount, referenceTypes, questionLength, answerLength, questionSample |
| `feedback_ack_added` | The 🧠 ack reaction posted back to the user | reactionName, chunkTs |
| `feedback_ack_failed` | The 🧠 ack was rejected by Slack | reason (`already_reacted` / `permission_denied` / `unknown`), chunkTs, errMsg |
| `correction_pending` | 👎 created a pending-correction KV record; user prompted for the correction text | channel, threadTs, answerTs, flaggedKBCount, flaggedDocCount, ttlSec |
| `correction_saved` | User replied with a correction; entry saved to KB and funnel closed | channel, threadTs, answerTs, correctionLength, timeSincePendingMs, flaggedKBCount, correctionSample |

**The `answerTs` field** is the stable identifier for the whole answer — equal to chunk 0's TS regardless of which chunk the user reacted on. Use it to join reaction events across the same answer (e.g. to see if the user reacted on chunk 1 and also replied with a correction later).

### Useful queries

- **Silent-drop rate:** `count(reaction_skipped) / count(reaction_received)` — should be low in steady state; a spike in `no_qa_context` indicates either stale Q&A records (>7-day TTL) or a bug.
- **Chunk-reaction distribution:** `feedback_saved.chunkIndex` bucketed — if users reliably react on chunk 1+, the compact-answer prompt isn't working; if they only react on chunk 0, the 2-chunk marker-drop heuristic is fine.
- **👎 funnel completion:** `count(correction_saved) / count(correction_pending)` — low means users don't follow through; consider shortening the pending TTL or changing the prompt.
- **Feedback feature value:** correlate `prompt_feedback_included.totalEntries > 0` turns with subsequent `feedback_saved.type = "positive"` rates — does having feedback in context correlate with higher-quality answers?
- **Reaction latency:** bucket `feedback_saved.latencyMs` — immediate reactions (<30s) are higher signal than day-later reactions.

### Error Events (all flows)

| Event | When | Key data |
|-------|------|----------|
| `error` | Any unhandled error in a flow | flow, message |

The `flow` field identifies which handler failed: `mention`, `thread_followup`, `reaction_checkmark`, `reaction_thumbsup`, `reaction_thumbsdown`.

## Debugging Common Issues

### "Bot doesn't respond"

Filter for `mention_received` — if it's missing, the webhook isn't reaching your function. Check Slack Event Subscriptions URL.

If `mention_received` exists but no `agent_complete`, the agent loop is timing out. Check `agent_tool_call` events to see how many rounds were used and which tools were called.

### "Answer is wrong"

Look at `agent_tool_call` events to see what the agent searched for and which files it read. This reveals whether the agent looked at the right sources or went down the wrong path.

### "Index not rebuilding"

If you see `index_cache_hit` on every request, the SHA hasn't changed since the last build. If you see `index_build_error`, the GitHub API call failed (check PAT permissions).

### "Feedback not working"

First check the reaction funnel — a feedback event that never resulted in action now always leaves a log:

1. Search for `reaction_received` with the user's `reactingUser` and the approximate time.
2. Look for a matching `feedback_saved` (success) or `reaction_skipped` (drop).
   - `reason: "no_qa_context"` → the reacted-on message has no stored Q&A context. Either it's not an answer chunk, or the 7-day TTL expired. Post-#114, Q&A is stored against every chunk of a split answer.
   - `reason: "bot_own_reaction"` → the bot reacted to itself; benign.
   - `reason: "target_not_bot_message"` → the user reacted on a human message; benign.
3. If `feedback_saved` fired but the user didn't see a 🧠 ack, look for `feedback_ack_failed` — usually `already_reacted`, which is benign.

For the 👎 correction funnel specifically, expect `correction_pending` immediately after `feedback_saved` (type=negative), and `correction_saved` only if the user typed a reply within 24h.


After a 👍/👎, look for a `feedback_saved` event with the matching `type`. If missing, look for `reaction_skipped` with the reason — the Q&A context may have expired (7-day TTL), the reacted-to message may not be a bot answer, or the bot reacted to its own message (`bot_own_reaction`). See the "Feedback Events" section above for the full funnel.

## Implementation

The logger is in `src/lib/logger.ts`:

```typescript
// Simple structured log
log("event_name", { key: "value" });

// Request-scoped logger (all calls share a requestId)
const rlog = createRequestLogger();
rlog("step_one", { data: "..." });
rlog("step_two", { data: "..." });
// Both entries have the same requestId
```

Every call goes through one code path — `console.log` (or `console.error` for events containing "error") with a JSON payload. In prod with a DSN configured, Sentry's `consoleLoggingIntegration` captures each call and ships it to the Logs UI; in local dev/CI the integration is a silent no-op and logs only reach stdout. Either way, the application code is the same.

Sentry init lives in `sentry.server.config.ts` (project root) and is loaded via `instrumentation.ts` on the Node runtime. See those files for tunable options (`SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`, etc.).
